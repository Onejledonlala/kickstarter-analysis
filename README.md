# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

### Overview of Project
The essences of the analysis is to show the different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. This analysis reveals a high level of success in the theater catagory, majorly in the months of *May and June*, but apparently declines afterwards to the end of the year.

### Analysis and Challenges
#### Analysis
The analysis was performed using pivot tables for the first deliverable - Theatre outcome by launch date, setting parameters on outcomes filtering through the theater category and its years. A line graph was constructed to show the relationship between possible outcomes (successful, failed, and canceled).

On the second deliverable which was outcome based on goals, different ranges were set to show result on possible outcomes of the financial goals. Another line graph was created to reveal percentages on the outcome on the different goal ranges.

### Results
From this analysis, certain relevant informations below gives more light to its understanding 
- Conclusions drawn from theatre outcomes are: 
  - The year it was highly successful in the month of May
  - No shows were canceled in october
- Massive failure to success of goals from range 45000 to 49999, the goal toward such high range is unsuccessful to achieve
- Limitations could be lack of information i.e. weather conditions or pandemic, in anticipation of data
- Charts like the *Pie* or *Spider & Radar* can show best interpretation of percentage readings in a glance
